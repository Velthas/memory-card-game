**Live at:** https://velthas.github.io/memory-card-game

Pokememory is a simple card memory game based on pokemon. To increase their max score, users will have to click on cards that have never been clicked on before.

This is a React project to improve knowledge of hooks and functional components. 
## 1. Functionality
As mentioned earlier, this game is based off the popular memory card game. When the project page is opened, 12 cards with Pok√©mons from the third gen. will be displayed, each with their name and sprite. 

Clicking on any card can have two possible effects:

 - **Card was already clicked:** score is set back to 0
 - **Card was not clicked before:** score is increased, and if the current score exceeds the max score, max score is updated as well.

 As it stands, project might be updated to feature levels to increase possible maximum score, but considering the scope of the project I don't think I will be updating it soon. Who knows, though.
